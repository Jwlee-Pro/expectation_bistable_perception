%% Voxel selection module (overview)
% 1. Compute correlations with model regressors
% 2. Significant variance of BOLD is explained with expectation
% 3. Explained variance by expectation should be larger than the alternatives 
% 4. Cluster size should be larger than 100
% 5. Define the ROI using xjview/fsl/spm


%% Compute correlations with model regressors
% Candidates regressors: expectation, choice, decision variables (optional)
% Computed correlations: pearson correlation, part correlation 


%% Significant variance of BOLD is explained with expectation
% Significance is calculated based on spm12
% FDR-corrected p<0.05, effect size (heuristic criterion) 


%% Explained variance by expectation should be larger than the alternatives 
% R^2 of expectation should be larger than that of choice or decision variable (optional) 

%% Cluster size should be larger than 100

%% Define the ROI using xjview/fsl/spm
% This step should be done manually using xjview
