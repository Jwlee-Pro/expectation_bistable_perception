%% Tests on decoded states (overview)
% 1. From SVR-decoded states, calculate RT correlation 
% 2. Check choice-invariance (Bayesian factor) 
% 3. Figure drawing (binning, sliding binning) 


%% Choice-expectation dependency test  
% No choice-depdency 
% Significant correlation with behavior RT


%% Save statistics 
% Bayesian factors for each bin
